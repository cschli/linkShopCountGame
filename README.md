# unit-4-game: Crystal Collector (Link's Nightmare/Rupee Cashier)
In this game, you play as Link, who has been teleported to an alternate dimension, where he is forced to become a cashier for a rupee shop. His customers will purchase something, and require Link to provide them with the _exact change_ in rupees. Link is provided with 4 magical rupee dispensers that he can click to dispense rupees to the customer. 

The problem is, the rupee generators are designed by a sadistic madman, and will dispense a random amount for every customer. The amount it dispenses is also unknown, so until Link actually begins dispensing from that rupee generator, he will not know how much it dispenses.

If Link wishes to provide proper customer service, he must dispense the correct amount of change for his customer, as indicated per his target change amount. If he succeeds, the customer leaves happily and Link is provided a "Win", as well as a customer satisfaction trophy.

If Link dispenses over the correct amount, the customer will become enraged, and brutally beat Link, causing him to lose 1 heart. Link has a total of 4 hearts, and upon losing all 4 hearts he will die, and the game will end.

To restart the game at any point, click the "Reset" button provided.

When the game ends, if the player scored number of wins higher than previous attempts, the high score will be stored on the page.

Since this is Link's nightmare, there's no way to win the game once and for all. But hey, you can collect endless numbers of customer trophies!
